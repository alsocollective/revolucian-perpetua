- website not selectable?
- Tapping has been optimized, however thresholds are device dependent meaning we need to track user agents and set thresholds for each device.
- We should coach them through an initial tapping exercise

+ Perhaps we need a setTimeout for tapping so it only sends within a small window. This will avoid taps being registered on the decay of a tap.
